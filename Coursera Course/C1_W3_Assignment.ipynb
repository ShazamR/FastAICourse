These numbers (or weights) for each word are learned using various machine\n","learning models, which we will explore in more detail later in this specialization. Rather than make you code the\n","machine learning models from scratch, we will show you how to use them. In the real world, you can always load the\n","trained word vectors, and you will almost never have to train them from scratch. In this assignment, you will:\n","\n","- Predict analogies between words.\n","- Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the word embeddings and plot them in two dimensions.\n","- Compare word embeddings by using a similarity measure (the cosine similarity).\n","- Understand how these vector space models work.\n","\n","\n","\n","## 1.0 Predict the Countries from Capitals\n","\n","In the lectures, we have illustrated the word analogies\n","by finding the capital of a country from the country. \n","We have changed the problem a bit in this part of the assignment. You are asked to predict the **countries** \n","that corresponds to some **capitals**.\n","You are playing trivia against some second grader who just took their geography test and knows all the capitals by heart.\n","Thanks to NLP, you will be able to answer the questions properly. In other words, you will write a program that can give\n","you the country by its capital. That way you are pretty sure you will win the trivia game.
